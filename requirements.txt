# Additional utilities
argparse  # Usually built-in, but included for clarity
pathlib   # Usually built-in, but included for clarity
dataclasses  # Usually built-in for Python 3.7+

# Optional: For advanced FBX parsing if bpy is not available

# Note: bpy (Blender as Python module) installation instructions:
# 
# Method 1 (Recommended):
# pip install bpy
#
# Method 2 (If Method 1 fails):
# 1. Download Blender
# 2. Add Blender's Python path to PYTHONPATH
# 3. Or use Blender's built-in Python interpreter
#
# Method 3 (For advanced users):
# Build Blender from source with Python module support
#
# Platform-specific notes:
# - Windows: May require Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable
# - macOS: Should work with pip install bpy
# - Linux: May need additional system libraries (OpenGL, etc.)
